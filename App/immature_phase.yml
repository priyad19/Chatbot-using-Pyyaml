      - "The processes are 1) preparation of seedlings for planting 2) developing field layout 3) making of planting holes Preparation for planting in the field
        Preparation for planting in the field
        * Seedlings aged 10 - 12 months are ready for planting the field. 3-4 weeks prior to the planting, polybags are rotated. Seedlings need to be well watered prior to
        planting. Seedlings with height of more than 1.5 meter are cut to a height of 1.2 meter.
        Field layout  planting distance and directions
        * The first step in the process of laying an oil palm field out is to gather wooden pegs that will be used to peg out the farm land carefully before out-planting of seedlings
        are carried out. The purpose of pegging out the field is to make sure that you have the correct distances between your seedlings when planted out. It is also important
        that you have the correct density of palms on your land. This is because to get a good yield, you must plant the correct density of palms on your land. If the density
        of palm is less, you will not get the right yield, and if the density is high the competition will increase for the space for the plants, as the roots will entangle
        thereby, the yield will be low because the leaves will not have enough air and sun light
        * Oil palm seedlings should be planted in a triangulated pattern in order for the trees to minimize light competition between the palms. The layout should also be done
        across the slope of the farm land
        * Planting holes are arranged in north-south direction. Trace lines across the slope and put in your pegs in straight lines; leave 7.8 meters between rows and 9 m
        between pegs. In this way you can plant 143 oil palms per hectare; this is the best density. While tree density in sloping land is 132. Pull out tree stumps and remove
        fallen trees close to the pegs, because these stumps and trees would interfere with the oil palms
        Making planting holes
        * Planting holes are made with dimensions of 0.60 x 0.60 x 0.60 meter, manually using a hoe or using hole digger
        * Biofungicide Trichoderma is applied at a rate of 200 g/hole, and Rock Phosphate at 500 gram/hole."

    - "soil conservation"
    - "importance of soil conservation"
    responses:
    - "Soil conservation is important because soil erosion causes the loss of fertile top soil. Soils in the tropics are often very sensitive to erosion, because there is much rainfall which washes the soil away from slopes. Once the soil is lost, it takes a long time to recover, and the fertility of eroded area will be reduced during this period. It is difficult to produce good yields on very eroded soils and soil erosion should therefore be prevented as much as possible. In addition to the loss of fertile top soil, erosion also usually results in the loss of fertilizers and organic material. The goals of soil conservation are to maintain good soil fertility, prevent erosion of the topsoil, limit the loss of fertilizers, and to optimize use of water."

Each bund could be 1.0 to 1.5m wide and run continuously along the contour. Depending on the susceptibility of the land to water run-off and erosion, they could be constructed at intervals of 20 to 30m."

Individual platforms should be created around each palm. Platforms should have the following design characteristics: Platform diameter should be 4—5 m, Platform surface should slope 3 to 6 0 ( 5—10%) in the opposite direction to the slope. Here are the steps to construct a planting platform: Step 1. Dig soil from the upper part of the circle and place it on the lower part. Ensure the bottom (supporting) part of the platform is wider than the top. Step 2. Compact the soil at the downhill edge of the platform to prevent washing away. Step 3. Stack fronds just upslope from the platform to reduce water flows."

However, this method, although cheap and convenient, is highly unsustainable as it contributes to haze and transboundary air pollution. Since the great haze and air pollution that was experienced in the late 1990s in Southeast Asia, the oil palm industry has adopted the zero burning technique as a method for land clearing where the old tree stand is felled, shredded, stacked ad left in situ to decompose naturally. This environmentally sound approach does not cause air pollution and the recycling of the plant biomass improves the soil organic matter and soil fertility. Advice on how to implement the zero burning technique is given in the Guidelines for the Implementation of the ASEAN Policy on Zero Burning."

      is properly calibrated so that it is clear how much water comes out of the sprayer every minute.
      Equipment= The most commonly used knapsack sprayers are the so-called ‘lever-operated knapsack sprayers’
      Chemical weeding using a knapsack sprayer Prepare the sprayer and do the spraying following these steps
      Step 1. Fill the knapsack sprayer with water (e.g. 10 L).
      Step 2. Add the herbicide (e.g. 100 or 200 ml). Note (Always use gloves while adding the herbicide!).
      Step 3. Close the lid and shake well.
      Step 4. Fill the sprayer up with more water (e.g. another 5 L) until it is full.
      Step 5. Spray the weeds with the herbicide solution. Per hectare it is normal to spray 50—200 L of solution (0.5 to 2 L of herbicide) depending on the number of weeds. When
      doing clear-weeding (not normally a good idea!) more herbicide will be needed (e.g. up to 300 L/ha).
      Step 6. Keep clear records of when you have sprayed, and how much.
      Step 7. If it rains less than 4 hours after spraying, repeat the treatment."

      Steps to control infestations of leaf eating pests such as bagworms, nettle caterpillars and tussock moths are:
      Prevention Measures:
      • Plantation management and cleanliness meets the standard criteria and promote biological control of pest populations
      • Continuous and periodic monitoring and reporting on leaf eating pest infestation to the Extension Officer
      Biological Control:
      • Planting beneficial plants along the plantation border to increase natural enemy/beneficial insect populations to reduce attack of leaf eating pests. This plant
        becomes hosts for beneficial insects and supplies honey/nectar to them
      • Natural enemies/beneficial insects are capable parasitic insects that kill leaf eating pests for example by laying eggs on pest’s larvae
      • Spraying using beneficial bacteria, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is effective in killing leaf eating pests and it is harmless to the beneficial insects, animals and humans
      Chemical Control:
      • Selective pesticide application done through the directed spray application or the trunk injection method on the oil palm stem/trunk
      • The chemical spray method will have an effect on the beneficial insects while injection on
        the trunk of the tree is more suitable for the treatment of mature palms and seriously infected trees
      • When using systemic insecticides through stem injection methods, the insecticide will
        move through tree sap/fluid and be taken to the leaf tissue. Therefore, only leaf eating pest will be affected
      • The effectiveness of using injections on the trunk can takes up to 24 hours if it is done on

      as standing logs, dead and rotting wood and rubbish piles must be cleared from the plantation to prevent outbreaks. Meanwhile, felled oil palm trunk need to be pulverize to
      restrict the availability of the breeding grounds for the beetles. Cultivation of leguminous plants can also help to reduce the reproduction of Rhinoceros beetles where it acts as a
      physical barrier to the breeding sites.
      Rhinoceros beetle is a also common pest in coconut palms, so if there is a coconut
      plantation nearby, attacks on oil palm plantations are more likely to occur. Severe

      nitrogen (N) fertilizers are manufactured from petroleum or natural gas whereas the
      chemical elements such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and other trace elements in
      inorganic fertilizers are prevalently mined from the earth. Likewise organic fertilizers,
      balanced inorganic fertilizers are also high in macronutrients i.e. NPK. For instance,
      inorganic fertilizers products with high NPK include ammonium nitrate, ammonium
      sulphate, rock phosphate, muriate of potash (potassium chloride), etc. Nutrient delivery
      with inorganic fertilizers for plant growth is rapid but it raises the N concentration in the

      leaves/fronds/trunks, empty fruit bunches (EFBs) and palm oil mill effluents (POME). When
      compared to inorganic fertilizers, nutrient delivery with organic fertilizers for plant growth
      is slower because organic fertilizers rely on the soil organisms to break down the organic
      materials to release nutrients for plant uptakes. Generally, the cost of organic fertilizers is
      also more expensive than inorganic fertilizers. Nevertheless, soil composition and texture
      are better with organic fertilizers because organic fertilizers will continue to enhance the
      soil after the required nutrients have been taken up by the plant and thus, organic fertilizers are more environmentally friendly."

      disruption to its growth and development functions that include decreased leaf expansion,
      leaf surface area and leaf number. As phosphorus component plays an important role in
      photosynthesis process, lack of the component in the palm tree will reduce the efficiency of
      photosynthesis attributed to the reduction of chlorophyll content in the plant tissues."

    patterns: 
    - "What is the effective fertilization method for palm oil plants?"
    responses:
    - "Fertilization should be done after all weeds have been removed to avoid
      competition for fertilizer. The effective placement of fertilizer and the appropriate quantity
      depends on the age of the tree. For trees that are close to drainage, fertilizer should be
      sprinkled on the pile of fronds to prevent nutrient runoff into water drainage. The most
      suitable time to fertilize is in the moderately humid season."

      erosion and loss of soil organic matter, maintain soil moisture and temperature, control
      rhinoceros beetle attacks, supply nitrogen through N fixation and to attract the presence of
      insects that are natural enemies of pests. One of the ideal legume cover crops for planting in the plantation is Mucuna bracteata."
  - tag: micronutrients
    patterns: 
    - "What are the required macronutrients and micronutrients for plant growth and development?"
    responses :
    - " Macronutrients are nutrients that are required in large quantities by the plants but they are easily deficient in plants. Whereas, micronutrients are referred to as nutrients that
        are required in small quantities by the plants and they are less frequently deficient in plants
        as compared to macronutrients. Both macronutrients and micronutrients are important for
        optimum plant growth and development. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and
        magnesium (Mg) are the main examples of the vital macronutrients required in plants.
        Whereas, boron (B), copper (Cu), iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) are the micronutrients. When the
        plants lack any of these nutrients (nutrients imbalance), stunted growth and decreased productivity in plants will occur."

  - tag: harvest_practices
    patterns: 
    - "What are good harvesting practices?"
    responses :
    - "Good harvesting practices are practices that result in large quantities of fresh fruit bunches harvested, high oil extraction rates, and good quality oil. Good harvesting practices include:
      • Harvesting using correct procedures (frond cutting, bunch cutting);
      • Harvesting only ripe bunches;
      • Good and fast transport of the bunches to the mill;
      • Limited loss of loose fruits in the field or during transport (loose fruits have an oil content of more than 40 percent!)
      The free fatty acid content will be less than 5% if harvesting standards are followed; in particular it is important to ensure fast transportation to the mill and harvesting fruit at the correct ripeness.
      For good transportation, the roads need to be maintained. While road maintenance can require large investments, bad conditions can make transportation of the harvest slow and
      more expensive. To avoid loss of fruit bunches or oil quality during its transport to the mill, the cooperatives, farmer groups or traders should set clear rules which include:
      • Quality of the truck;
      • Speed of transportation;
      • Covering of full trucks with a net."

       harvest fresh fruit bunches without damaging the fruit and the palm;
       get fresh fruit bunches with excellent oil content and quality;
       get maximum profit from harvested fresh fruit bunches.
      Good harvesting practice:
       All ripe fruit bunches are harvested at every harvesting round;
       Harvesting is done at least once every 10 days;
       Bunches are harvested at the right time and ripeness and in the right way,without causing damage to the bunch and the palm;
       The minimum ripeness standard of 1—4 loose fruits per bunch is followed (only if harvesting is done at least every ten days);
       Stalks are cut to less than 2 cm in length;
       The quantity of harvested fresh fruit bunches is correctly recorded at each harvest.

    - "Why do my palm trees often produce male flowers instead of female flowers?"
    responses :
    - " Typically, oil palms produce unisexual male and female flowers in alternating
      cycles. However, oil palm has the ability to change the gender of the flowers produced in
      response to environmental factors. Through research and observation, oil palm sex
      determination is strongly influenced by climatic factors, with the production of male
      inflorescences promoted by water deficit or water stress. In addition, stress associated with
      leaf pruning was found to cause female inflorescences to experience higher abortion rates than male inflorescences."
